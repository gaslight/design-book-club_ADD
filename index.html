				<p>Information is freer than ever — but that means that there's more to dig through to find gems</p>

					<h2>Design: The New Hotness</h2>
					<p>Design, once seen as niche and auxiliary, has come front-and-center in a world where people use more and more software products and come to expect them to look and work well.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Design: The New Hotness</h2>
					<p>Good design is very clearly tied to product success.</p>
				</section>

					<h2>Design: The New Hotness</h2>
					<p>It would then follow that designers, those agents of design, would also be the new hotness, right?</p>

					<h2>Everyone's a Critic</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Non-Designers are immersed in designed experiences and can tell what looks good, but can't express why.</li>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>To find the right solution, you need a clearly defined problem.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>Set goals and key progress indicators to establish what success looks like. These can be drawn from what's important to your stakeholders.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>You must be consciously aware of each decision made and why.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Ask "what problem am I trying to solve with this?" and then answer it. Write it down to get in the habit!</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>Practice describing your designs without visual aides to become more precise in how you clarify your designs and thinking.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>Making sure a design actually resonates with users is grounded in intentionality. "How does this affect the user?"</p>
					<p class="fragment">It's entirely legitimate to make your best guesses and then try them out.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>Practice writing stories about these design changes within the context of how they affect the user.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>The most sicknasty design doesn't get you anywhere if you can't sell people on it.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Even worse, people will continue to suggest other alternatives if they're not convinced that you're right.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>You need to get clients and other team members on your level!</p>
					<p>Shared understanding of what you're trying to achieve and where you're headed helps achieve this.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>To properly share your design savvy with others on your team takes a little additional legwork.</p>
					<p>It's easy to land on what looks like the right decision, but leave no stone unturned &mdash; finding these other solutions and knowing why they don't work allows you to summon this information later if they're pitched as alternatives.</p>

					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>Being right is satisfying, but knowing why and being thoughtful are more important than being able to design the perfect solution every time.</p>

<h2><small>Chapter 3</small></h2>
<h2>Understanding Relationships</h2>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>First, Improving Communication</h2>
	<p>The single most important thing you can do to improve communication is to improve relationships.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Relationships & Stakeholder</h2>
	<p>Uxers are so good at putting the user first but often fail to do the same for the stakeholders, the people who have influence over the project.</p>
	<p class="fragment">Applying the same principles we use to put the users first should be applied to the people we work with, that way we can create a better product together </p>
</section>
<section data-background="https://media.giphy.com/media/10LKovKon8DENq/giphy.gif">
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Relationships & Stakeholder</h2>
	<p>In order to approach them the right way we need to: </p>
	<ul>
		<li class="fragment">See them as human</li>
		<li class="fragment">Create shared experiences</li>
		<li class="fragment">Develop empathy</li>
		<li class="fragment">Ask good questions</li>
		<li class="fragment">Identifying influencers</li>
		<li class="fragment">Building good relationships</li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>See them as human</h2>
	<p>There are always things that are influencing people’s behaviors that we don’t know about and there will always be things that we simply can’t predict.</p>
</section>
<section data-background="https://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/2015/11/12/635829492208789717-2055683014_derek.gif">
</section>
<section>
	<h2>See them as human</h2>
	<p> A person’s attitudes and responses to your work might have more to do with the things outside of what you’re showing them. </p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Create shared experiences</h2>
	<p>When we don’t have anything in common with another person, it’s nearly impossible to talk to them.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Create shared experiences</h2>
	<p>Finding ways to create connections with other people is an important step toward understanding them.</p>
	<p class="fragment">Connections can be made easily through simple questions (non work questions!). </p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Develop empathy</h2>
	<p>Having empathy for stakeholders allows you to understand from their perspective.</p>
	<p></p>
</section>
<section data-background="https://media.giphy.com/media/Hys63WZ4UHlAc/giphy.gif">
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Develop empathy</h2>
	<p>It simply means that your priority for communicating with them has shifted from a position of defense to one of solidarity.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Ask good questions</h2>
	<p>You should learn to view things from the perspective of your stakeholders in the same way that you would with users of your application</p>
	<p class="fragment">By asking questions. </p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Identifying Influencers</h2>
	<p>Every project has a variety of people who influence its outcome, the three main types you need to understand are: </p>
	<ul>
		<li class="fragment">Team Influencers</li>
		<li class="fragment">Executive Influencers</li>
		<li class="fragment">External Influencers	</li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Build Good Relationships</h2>
	<p>Communication is much easier in good relationships.</p>
	<p class="fragment">Good relationships take work.</p>
	<p class="fragment">Take the time to do the simple things that will help you to improve your relationships and, as a byproduct, your communication with each other</p>

<h2>Reducing Cognitive Load</h2>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Reducing Cognitive Load</h2>
	<p>Reducing the cognitive load not only for the stakeholders but our team and for ourselves so we can have a</p>
	<p class="fragment">Succesful</p>
	<p class="fragment">Productive</p>
	<p class="fragment">Valuable <strong> Meeting </strong></p>
	<h2 class="fragment">But how??</h2>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Remove Distractions!</h2>
	<p>A lot of people are easily distracted by things that simply do not matter to the goal of the meeting.</p>
</section>
<section data-background="https://i2.wp.com/www.thedebutanteball.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/squirrel.gif">
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Remove Distractions!</h2>
	<p>Getting to know people can help identify what is distracting to them, so you can remove those things from the conversation. </p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Anticipate Reactions</h2>
	<p>When we combine what we know about the infleuncers of the project with the values they carry in their role, we can make some pretty good guesses about how they’ll respond to our designs </p>
</section>
<section data-background="https://media.giphy.com/media/76dXlFZZEqNH2/giphy.gif">
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Anticipate Reactions</h2>
	<p>So! Using this information we should curate the flow of our design discussion.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Create a Support Network</h2>
	<p>Getting other people to support your decisions is about showing that you’re not alone in your ideas.</p>
</section>
<section data-background="https://sixcolors.com/images/content/2016/bb8-thumbsup.gif">
</section>
<!-- <section>
	<h2>Create a Support Network</h2>
	<ul>
		<li class="fragment">The Ringer: Backup support when/if we don't remember everything that needs to be said in a meeting.  </li>
		<li class="fragment">Identifying People: Beforehand figure out who's on board with your design. This can easiliest be found from your own team. </li>
		<li class="fragment">People Get it: Find the people who will by your side to accomplish your vision. It's not just one person's idea but an idea that support by others.</li>
	</ul>
</section> -->
<section>
	<p>& Finally</p>
	<h2>The Dress Rehearsal</h2>
	<p>Now that you understand your stakeholders, have removed the distractions, anticipated their reactions, and gathered a group of people to back you up, it’s time to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li class="fragment">Make a List</li>
		<li class="fragment">Practice Out loud</li>
		<li class="fragment">Prep Everyone</li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Now, Let's Have</h2>
	<h2>A Succesful Meeting</h2>
	<p>Reducing Cognitive Load for us and our Stakeholders allows everyone to focus on the decisions at hand creating more productive conversations.</p>
	<p class="fragment"><strong>Productivity Rules!!</strong></p>
