					<p>Good design is very clearly tied to product success.</p>

					<p>To find the right solution, you need a clearly defined problem.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>Set goals and key progress indicators to establish what success looks like. These can be drawn from what's important to your stakeholders.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>You must be consciously aware of each decision made and why.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Ask "what problem am I trying to solve with this?" and then answer it. Write it down to get in the habit!</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>Practice describing your designs without visual aides to become more precise in how you clarify your designs and thinking.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>Making sure a design actually resonates with users is grounded in intentionality. "How does this affect the user?"</p>
					<p class="fragment">It's entirely legitimate to make your best guesses and then try them out.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>Practice writing stories about these design changes within the context of how they affect the user.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>The most sicknasty design doesn't get you anywhere if you can't sell people on it.</p>

					<p>Shared understanding of what you're trying to achieve and where you're headed helps achieve this.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>To properly share your design savvy with others on your team takes a little additional legwork.</p>
					<p>It's easy to land on what looks like the right decision, but leave no stone unturned &mdash; finding these other solutions and knowing why they don't work allows you to summon this information later if they're pitched as alternatives.</p>

				<section>
					<h2>First, Improving Communication</h2>
					<p>The single most important thing you can do to improve communication is to improve relationships.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Relationships & Stakeholder</h2>
					<p>Uxers are so good at putting the user first but often fail to do the same for the stakeholders, the people who have influence over the project.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Applying the same principles we use to put the users first should be applied to the people we work with, that way we can create a better product together </p>
				</section>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Relationships & Stakeholder</h2>
					<p>In order to approach them the right way we need to: </p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">See them as human</li>
						<li class="fragment">Create shared experiences</li>
						<li class="fragment">Develop empathy</li>
						<li class="fragment">Ask good questions</li>

					<h2>See them as human</h2>
					<p>There are always things that are influencing people’s behaviors that we don’t know about and there will always be things that we simply can’t predict.</p>

				<section>
					<h2>See them as human</h2>
					<p> A person’s attitudes and responses to your work might have more to do with the things outside of what you’re showing them. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Create shared experiences</h2>
					<p>When we don’t have anything in common with another person, it’s nearly impossible to talk to them.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Create shared experiences</h2>
					<p>Finding ways to create connections with other people is an important step toward understanding them.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Connections can be made easily through simple questions (non work questions!). </p>

					<h2>Develop empathy</h2>
					<p>Having empathy for stakeholders allows you to understand from their perspective.</p>

				<section data-background="https://media.giphy.com/media/Hys63WZ4UHlAc/giphy.gif">

					<h2>Develop empathy</h2>
					<p>It simply means that your priority for communicating with them has shifted from a position of defense to one of solidarity.</p>

					<p>You should learn to view things from the perspective of your stakeholders in the same way that you would with users of your application</p>
					<p class="fragment">By asking questions. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Identifying Influencers</h2>
					<p>Every project has a variety of people who influence its outcome, the three main types you need to understand are: </p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Team Influencers</li>
						<li class="fragment">Executive Influencers</li>
						<li class="fragment">External Influencers	</li>

					<h2>Remove Distractions!</h2>
					<p>Getting to know people can help identify what is distracting to them, so you can remove those things from the conversation. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Anticipate Reactions</h2>
					<p>When we combine what we know about the infleuncers of the project with the values they carry in their role, we can make some pretty good guesses about how they’ll respond to our designs </p>

					<h2>Anticipate Reactions</h2>
					<p>So! Using this information we should curate the flow of our design discussion.</p>

					<p>Getting other people to support your decisions is about showing that you’re not alone in your ideas.</p>

						<p> &#8213;Calvin Coolidge</p>
					</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2> Implicit Activities </h2>
					<p>
						<strong> Be empathetic.</strong> Hear what your stakeholders are saying and try to understand the meaning of what's being said from their perspective.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment"> Let them talk </li>
						<li class="fragment"> Hear what isn't being said </li>

					<h2> Let them Talk </h2>
					<p> Give your stakeholders the space they need to fully describe their ideas. </p>
					<p class="fragment"> Three main benfits: </p>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment"> They will make themselves more clear </li>
						<li class="fragment"> It gives them confidence that they were understood </li>
						<li class="fragment"> It demonstrates that you value what they're saying </li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2> Trust is Everything </h2>
					<p> Showing that you can let someone express their ideas freely will help to build trust. </p>
					<p class="fragment"> They will be more likely to agree with you if you can relate to what they've said. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2> Hear What isn't Being Said</h2>
					<p>
						There is <strong>subtext</strong> to every bit of feedback. The better we can decode these messages, the better we can correct our course of action.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2> Uncover the Real Problem </h2>
					<p> People naturally jump to solutions. It's our job to identify the problems behind those solutions. </p>

						<p> &#8213;Mark Twain </p>
					</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2> The Three Purposes of the Pause </h2>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment"> Give them a chance to expand on, or correct, what they've just said. </li>
						<li class="fragment"> Let their statements sink in. Take a few seconds to check yourself and form an appropiate response. </li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Nonverbally communicate that what was just said is worth taking the time to seriously consider and ponder over for a moment.
							<p class="fragment"> Be aware of your <strong>body language</strong>. </p>

						<li class="fragment"> Notes keep the meeting on track. </li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2> Taking Better Notes </h2>
					<p> Your notes should be: </p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment"> <strong>Accessible</strong> - even during the meeting </li>
						<li class="fragment"> <strong>Organized</strong> - related to UI elements or agenda items </li>
						<li class="fragment"> <strong>Specific</strong> - who suggested what? </li>
						<li class="fragment"> <strong>Definitive</strong> - have you reached a decison or is there follow-up work that needs to be done? </li>
						<li class="fragment"> <strong>Actionable</strong> - if there's no action, it's not useful </li>
						<li class="fragment"> <strong>Referenced</strong> - add links, URLs, screenshots, ect. </li>
						<li class="fragment"> <strong>Forward-looking</strong> - make room for follow-up discussions for the next meeting. </li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2> Ask Questions </h2>
					<p> So much of listening is just getting the other person to talk. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2> Helpful Questions </h2>
					<ul>
						<li> What problem are you trying to solve? </li>
						<li> What are the advantages of doing it this way? </li>
