				<p>Information is freer than ever — but that means that there's more to dig through to find gems</p>
				<p class="fragment">The Design Squad™, in the interest of ongoing education, took on the task of reading and synthesizing content and then bringing it together.</p>

					<h2>Design: The New Hotness</h2>
					<p>Design, once seen as niche and auxiliary, has come front-and-center in a world where people use more and more software products and come to expect them to look and work well.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Design: The New Hotness</h2>
					<p>Good design is very clearly tied to product success.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Design: The New Hotness</h2>
					<p>It would then follow that designers, those agents of design, would also be the new hotness, right?</p>

					<h2>Design[ers]: The Reality</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">UX is a young discipline that's still being figured out.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Designers are practiced in justifying design to designers, less so with those outside the discipline.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Design is as much about subjective personal preferences as it is about logically-made, research-backed decisions.</li>

					<h2>Everyone's a Critic</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Non-Designers are immersed in designed experiences and can tell what looks good, but can't express why.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Design is "special" in that people uninvolved can have an opinion on the "how" of the work, not just the "what".</li>

						<li>Be easy for users.</li>
						<li>Be supported by everyone.</li>

					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>To find the right solution, you need a clearly defined problem.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>Set goals and key progress indicators to establish what success looks like. These can be drawn from what's important to your stakeholders.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>You must be consciously aware of each decision made and why.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Ask "what problem am I trying to solve with this?" and then answer it. Write it down to get in the habit!</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>Practice describing your designs without visual aides to become more precise in how you clarify your designs and thinking.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>Making sure a design actually resonates with users is grounded in intentionality. "How does this affect the user?"</p>
					<p class="fragment">It's entirely legitimate to make your best guesses and then try them out.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>Practice writing stories about these design changes within the context of how they affect the user.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>The most sicknasty design doesn't get you anywhere if you can't sell people on it.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Even worse, people will continue to suggest other alternatives if they're not convinced that you're right.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>You need to get clients and other team members on your level!</p>
					<p>Shared understanding of what you're trying to achieve and where you're headed helps achieve this.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>To properly share your design savvy with others on your team takes a little additional legwork.</p>
					<p>It's easy to land on what looks like the right decision, but leave no stone unturned &mdash; finding these other solutions and knowing why they don't work allows you to summon this information later if they're pitched as alternatives.</p>

					<h2>Makings of a Successful Design</h2>
					<p>Being right is satisfying, but knowing why and being thoughtful are more important than being able to design the perfect solution every time.</p>
